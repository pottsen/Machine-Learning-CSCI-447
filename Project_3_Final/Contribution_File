For the code found in the project there 4 contributors:
Peter Ottsen the bold
--learning rate: passable
--momentum: eager
Justin McGowen the smart
--learning rate: commendable effort
--momentum: irritable
Bruce Clark the goofy
--learning rate: mediocre
--momentum: sleep deprived
Forest Edwards the noble
--learning rate: decent
--momentum: steady

Based on the results, the learning rate of the group far exceeded the network overall. Take that singularity! HUMANS >>>>>>>>>> MACHINES.
