Code from projects in the Montana State CSCI 447 - Machine Learning course. There were 4 projects in the class with an extra credit project. Each project required us to code multiple different algorithms from scratch. Every member had a direct hand in coding and/or checking each algorithm. A research journal inspired report was written for each project detailing the theory and results of each project.
