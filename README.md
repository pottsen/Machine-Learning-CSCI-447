Code from projects in the Montana State CSCI 447 - Machine Learning course. There were 5 projects in the class. Each project required us to code multiple different algorithms from scratch. Every member had a direct hand in coding and/or checking each algorithm. A research journal inspired report was written for each project detailing the theory and results of each project.

This class taught me a lot and was my first exposure to many things: Machine Learning, Statitical Evaluation, Pandas Library, Numpy Library. Looking back we were so focused on learning the algorithms and trying to figure out the libraries that we  missed some of the best practices when it comes to data cleaning. We did not leverage Pandas enough for string enumeration and scaling. I learned from this and was able to apply this at my data science internship the next summer. Implenting machine learning algorithms by hand also gave me a strong foundational knowledge in machine learning.
